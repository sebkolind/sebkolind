👋 Hi, I’m @sebkolind. I am a frontend engineer at [Public.com](https://public.com).

In my spare time I am building ⛺ [tent](https://github.com/tentjs/tent) - a jsx-free, super-lightweight and zero-dependency library to add interactivity to the web. My motivation for working on tent, is that I don't think you need JSX, SSR, special HTML syntax, or any other complicated technologies to build awesome interactive web apps. If you agree on any, or all, of the above, feel free to reach out or contribute to any of the ⛺ [projects](https://github.com/tentjs).
